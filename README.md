### Hi there! 👋

> A habits monitoring application, with the purpose of make our lives easier.
>
> This is an end-to-end application to help users create and track their daily habits. The application consists of three main components: the server (backend), the web application and the mobile application. Users can record new habits, mark them when completed, choose the days of the week they want to add them, and view a summary of their completed habits over the days.
>
> The habits monitoring API was developed in TypeScript, using the Fastify, Prisma, and other libraries, offering a complete and practical solution to manage your daily habits.
> For the web application we used React, TypeScript, Tailwind, Vite and some other tools. It offers an intuitive and user-friendly interface to create a habit, mark them when completed and view a summary of these daily habits.
> Taking advantage of the knowledge in React, ReactNative was used with Typescript for mobile app, using Expo to facilitate the initial settings.
>
> The first version was developed in the [Rocketseat](https://www.rocketseat.com.br/) NLW Return. After some months I decided to change some things in the project, putting into practice my experience acquired during that time,
reorganizing and improving the code and the structure of the project.
