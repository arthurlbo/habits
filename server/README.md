### Hi there! 👋

> A habits tracker api which allows users to track and monitor their daily habits efficiently. With this API, users can register new habits, define their recurrence and register if they were completed or not. In addition, it provides functionality to view the complete habits of your days.
>
> The database choice was SQLite, based on the simplicity. It doesn't require a lot of server setup or optimization to get good performance. And also simple syntax, which can make SQL code development and maintenance easier.
>
> The objective of this project was to improve my backend skills, developing something that is really useful in our daily lives.
